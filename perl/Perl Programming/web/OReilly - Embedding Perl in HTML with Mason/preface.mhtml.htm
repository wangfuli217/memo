<h1>Preface</h1><p class="content">
<a name="PREFACE"></a>

</p>
<p class="content">
Mason is a tool for embedding the Perl programming language into text, in order
to create text dynamically, most often in HTML. But Mason does not simply stop
at HTML. It can just as easily create XML, WML, POD, configuration files, or
the complete works of Shakespeare.
</p>
<p class="content">
Mason was originally written by Jonathan Swartz, with the help of the rest of
the CMP development team at CMP Media in 1996, and in its earliest incarnations
it was known as Scribe.
</p>
<p class="content">
Mason was first made publicly available as Version 0.1 in August of 1998. Since
that time, Jonathan Swartz has invited your humble authors to participate in
the further development of Mason. Mason has been expanded, and rewritten and is
much changed from those early days. This book covers Version 1.12 of Mason.
</p>
<a name="TOC-ANCHOR-1"></a>
<h2>Intended Audience</h2><p class="content">
<a name="PREFACE-SECT-1"></a>

</p>
<p class="content">
This book assumes that the reader is familiar with Perl at an intermediate
level and that common Perl idioms don't stop you in your tracks. While you need
not have written your own modules previously, familiarity with Perl's
object-oriented syntax will be helpful.
</p>
<p class="content">
Since Mason is most often used in the generation of web sites, this book
frequently presents its example in terms of generating HTML pages. You
definitely do not need to be an HTML expert to read this book, but a passing
familiarity with HTML will be helpful in understanding what the output is
intended to look like.
</p>
<p class="content">
As previously mentioned, Mason is well-suited for the generation of any sort of
dynamic text, including markup languages such as XML, as well as configuration
files, email bodies (think mail merge, perhaps), or even code.
</p>
<p class="content">
Finally, experience with <code>mod_perl</code> and Apache will be helpful for <a href="chapter-7.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-7.mhtml">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="chapter-9.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-9.mhtml">Chapter 9</a>, which discuss integrating Mason with <code>mod_perl</code> and CGI, respectively, though the rest of the book should be easily
comprehensible regardless of your familiarity with those particular topics.
</p>
<a name="TOC-ANCHOR-2"></a>
<h2>Requirements</h2><p class="content">
<a name="PREFACE-SECT-2"></a>

</p>
<p class="content">
As of Version 1.12, Mason requires Perl Version 5.00503 or later, as well as
the following modules available from CPAN: Class::Container 0.07+, File::Spec
0.8+, Params::Validate 0.24+, Exception::Class 1.01+, and Cache::Cache 1.00+.
</p>
<p class="content">
If you want to run Mason under <code>mod_perl</code>, you will need to have at least Version 1.22 of <code>mod_perl</code> installed (although installing the very latest version in the 1.<em>x</em> series is highly recommended). You'll also probably want Apache::Request
0.31+, though this is not strictly required.
</p>
<p class="content">
Some of the examples are designed to work in a web server context and may
require either CGI or <code>mod_perl</code> capabilities. For the CGI examples, any CGI-capable web server is sufficient,
though our configuration examples always assume Apache.
</p>
<p class="content">
Mason itself is designed to be platform-agnostic. Any behavior to the contrary
should be considered a bug in Mason, and bug reports are always welcome.
</p>
<p class="content">
In writing this book, we did our testing with Perl 5.6.1 and <code>mod_perl</code> 1.25, with Apache 1.3.22, so it is possible that something shown here may not
work as expected with other versions of these pieces of software. If you find
this to be the case, please let us know and we'll either fix the example or
make a note of the dependencies.
</p>

<h2>How to Read This Book</h2><p class="content">
<a name="PREFACE-SECT-3"></a>

</p>
<p class="content">
This book is not a reference manual. While certain chapters, notably <a href="chapter-4.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-4.mhtml">Chapter 4</a>, are reference-like in nature, the book as a whole builds chapter upon chapter and often refers to material covered earlier. Nonetheless, some readers may prefer to look at <a href="chapter-8.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-8.mhtml">Chapter 8</a> early, so an alternate path through the book might be to read that chapter right after <a href="chapter-1.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-1.mhtml">Chapter 1</a>.
</p>
<p class="content">
Once you become more familiar with Mason, we expect that much of the book will
still be useful as a reference, particularly <a href="chapter-4.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-4.mhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <a href="chapter-5.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-5.mhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <a href="chapter-6.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-6.mhtml">Chapter 6</a>, and <a href="chapter-7.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-7.mhtml">Chapter 7</a>.
</p>
<p class="content">
<a href="appendix-a.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/appendix-a.mhtml">Appendix A</a> and <a href="appendix-b.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/appendix-b.mhtml">Appendix B</a> present much of the same material as those chapters in a more streamlined reference style, and should also be useful long after you have become a Mason guru. <a href="appendix-c.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/appendix-c.mhtml">Appendix C</a> is a short discussion of editors you can use with Mason, and <a href="appendix-d.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/appendix-d.mhtml">Appendix D</a> covers Bricolage, a content management system based on Mason.
</p>
<p class="content">
Finally, the book includes a short glossary for those of you who are new to Mason and its terminology.
</p>

<div class="book-list-item-heading">
<a href="chapter-1.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-1.mhtml">Chapter 1</a></div>
<p class="content">
This chapter goes into more detail on what Mason is, highlights a few of its
most notable features, and also discusses some alternatives to Mason.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="book-list-item-heading">
<a href="chapter-2.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-2.mhtml">Chapter 2</a></div>
<p class="content">
Components are the basic building block in Mason. This chapter covers component
syntax and how components can call one another, much like Perl subroutines.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="book-list-item-heading">
<a href="chapter-3.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-3.mhtml">Chapter 3</a></div>
<p class="content">

<a href="chapter-4.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-4.mhtml">Chapter 4</a></div>
<p class="content">
This chapter is a bit more of a reference than those before it, as it has a lot
of ground to cover. We cover the APIs of various objects that you might want to
access from your components, primarily the Mason request object.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="book-list-item-heading">
<a href="chapter-5.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-5.mhtml">Chapter 5</a></div>
<p class="content">
Now that you know about component syntax, dhandlers, autohandlers, and a good
chunk of the Mason API, it's time to learn about some of Mason's more complex
features, like component methods and attributes, components that filter
content, and Mason subrequests.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="book-list-item-heading">
<a href="chapter-10.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-10.mhtml">Chapter 10</a></div>
<p class="content">
Mason is cool, but it's not magic. You still need to think about architecture
and design when designing a Mason-based application. We try to give you a few
things to think about here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<div class="book-list-item-heading">
<a href="chapter-11.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/chapter-11.mhtml">Chapter 11</a></div>

creating the much-overstressed POD markup language, all of which were essential
tools in the creation of this book. He'd like to thank Helen Plotkin and the
rest of the Math Forum for turning a naive young mathematician into a salty
programmer of the world. He'd like to thank his friends and family for not
asking too many questions about what he does all day. Most importantly, he
would like to thank Sheri Schechinger for being proud of a lowly open source
programmer, for asking questions about what he does all day, and for giving him
something so wonderful to come home to.

Dave would first and foremost like to thank his wife, Huey-Ling Chen, for her
support and humor, particularly the &quot;juice guy&quot; incident (he'd
explain, but then he'd have to juice you). He also wants to thank DoTheGood,
Inc., in particular Gabriel Cheifetz, for providing such a great place to work
while at the same time giving him enough free time to actually write this
thing. Jonathan Swartz deserves thanks and sympathy for letting Dave muck up
his code in such a cruel and twisted manner. Jon will no doubt get over the
shock one day. Finally, Dave wants to thank any friend or family member who had
the good grace not to cruelly mock him when they asked &quot;when will the book
be out?&quot; and he responded with something like &quot;oh, it's almost done,
it should be out in a few months.&quot; How wrong he was!

Both authors would like to thank our unshockable editor, Linda Mui, and our
crack team of technical reviewers: Alex Edelman, Jules Cook Graybill, Joe
Johnston, Mike Stok, Jonathan Swartz, David Wheeler, and John Williams. David
Wheeler in particular needs to be singled out for praise, not only for his
excellent appendix on Bricolage (<a href="appendix-d.mhtml.htm" tppabs="http://www.masonbook.com/book/appendix-d.mhtml">Appendix D)</a>, but also for his careful, detailed review. If his review comments were printed in the same typeface as this book, they would be about 100 pages long! Without his comments, and those of our other reviewers, this book would pretty much suck.

Joshua Chamas, Mark-Jason Dominus, Gerald Richter, and Sam Tregar provided
invaluable feedback on the comparisons to other templating systems, in many
cases defending their own systems from the ham-handed errors we made in
describing them.
</p>
<p class="content">
The entire group of overseers is responsible for transforming a disorganized
and error-ridden draft into what we hope is a useful resource for billions and
billions of Mason users. Or at least a few dozen.
